#### We want to add a button to the tally counter in Section 8.2 that allows an operator to undo an accidental button click. Provide a method

    public void undo()
    
that simulates such a button. As an added precaution, make sure that the operator cannot click the undo button more often than the count button.

    public Bug(int initialPosition)

    bugsy.turn();
    bugsy.move(); // Now the position is 10
Your main method should construct a bug, make it move and turn a few times, and print the actual and expected positions.

#### Reimplement the CashRegister class so that it keeps track of the price of each added  item in an ArrayList<Double>.

####  Reimplement the CashRegister class so that it keeps track of the total price as an integer:  the total cents of the price. For example, instead of storing 17.29, store the integer 1729.  Such an implementation is commonly used because it avoids the accumulation of roundoff errors.  Do not change the public interface of the class.
